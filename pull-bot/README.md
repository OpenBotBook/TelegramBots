This code creates a bot that listens for the command "/create_poll" and creates a poll with the question provided and options provided. Users can then select an option and the bot will reply with the selected option.

You'll need to replace "your_bot_token_goes_here" with the appropriate values. You can also adjust the code to add more functionality, such as adding more options or logging the poll results.
