# Overview about the bot:

This code creates a bot that listens for the command "/create_event" and creates an event with the name and time provided. Users can then select if they are going or not going to the event and the bot will reply with their selection.

You'll need to replace "your_bot_token_goes_here" with the appropriate values. 

# The next update will be:
Adjust the code to add more functionality, such as sending reminders before the event or logging the attendance.
